### SVG Example for Dynamic Showcase

Here’s an SVG of a computer monitor to fit the dynamic showcase theme:

```html
<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect x="10" y="10" width="80" height="60" fill="gray"/>
  <rect x="20" y="20" width="60" height="40" fill="black"/>
  <line x1="10" y1="70" x2="90" y2="70" stroke="black" stroke-width="3"/>
</svg>
